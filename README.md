# WeedWacker
Stop plants from growing where unwanted

# What it does
WeedWacker prevents plants which grow to unlimited length (kelp, vines) from growing
unless they are growing from a bone block.

Why? Vines and kelp can be the perfect foilage for a build, but they grow uncontrollably.
You could use a vanilla-compatible hack and block growth using string or blue stained glass panes,
but that's fragile in a survival world where people might be wandering around your build.

So, just like bonemeal magically creates flowers and grass, vines and kelp will now only
grow if they're siphoning nutriants from a bone block.
